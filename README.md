# 🚀 Wafer Fault Detection System  
### End-to-End Machine Learning System with AI Explainability, Monitoring & CI/CD Deployment

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a production-grade Machine Learning system designed to detect faulty semiconductor wafers using sensor data.  
It goes beyond model training and covers the complete ML lifecycle, including:

- Data ingestion from MongoDB
- Feature transformation
- Model training & evaluation
- Batch prediction
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- AI-powered explanation using Groq LLM
- Dockerized deployment with CI/CD on AWS EC2

👉 This project simulates real-world industrial ML systems used in manufacturing quality control.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In semiconductor manufacturing, faulty wafers lead to:
- Production loss
- Increased operational cost
- Quality degradation

The goal is to:
> Automatically classify wafers as Good or Bad using sensor readings  
> and provide explainable insights for engineers.

### ⚙️ ML Pipeline Explanation

1️⃣ Data Ingestion

  • Data fetched from MongoDB Atlas
  
  • Raw sensor data exported as CSV
  
  • Stored inside artifacts/
  
2️⃣ Data Transformation

  • Missing value handling
  
  • Scaling using RobustScaler
  
  • Train-test split
  
  • Preprocessor saved as .pkl
  
3️⃣ Model Training

  • Multiple models evaluated:
  
  • XGBoost
  
  • Random Forest
  
  • Gradient Boosting
  
  • SVM
  
  • Best model selected using validation accuracy
  
  • Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
  
4️⃣ Prediction Pipeline

 • Batch CSV upload

 • Preprocessor + model loaded

 • Predictions generated

 • Output CSV downloaded

 • Metrics updated for dashboard

### 📊 Monitoring Dashboard

 • The dashboard provides real-time ML monitoring, including:
 
 • Total predictions
 
 • Good vs Bad wafer count
 
 • Health score (% Good wafers)
 
 • Risk indicator bar
 
 • Trend analysis charts
 
 • Model name visibility
 
📌 Metrics are batch-wise (non-cumulative) for consistency..


### 🤖 AI Explainability (Groq LLM)

 • An AI assistant is integrated to explain prediction results.
 
 • LLM Provider: Groq
 
 • Model Used: llama-3.1-70b-versatile
 
 • Explains:
 
 • Why wafers are classified as bad
 
 • Overall quality insights
 
 • Engineering-friendly explanations
 
📌 AI runs independently of ML predictions (no hallucination).


### ☁️ Deployment & CI/CD

## 🐳 Docker

 • Complete application containerized
 
 • Same behavior across environments
 
## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

 • Triggered on every push
 
 • Steps:
 
 • Build Docker image
   
 • Push to AWS ECR
   
 • Deploy to AWS EC2 using self-hosted runner
 
## ☁️ AWS

 • EC2 (Ubuntu) as production server
 
 • ECR for Docker image registry
 
 • App exposed via public IP
